"""Bring your own audiobook: transcribe it, index it, serve it like the shipped one.

The built-in book is a SQLite file baked into the repo. A book someone adds at
runtime cannot be: the filesystem on a lambda is read-only, and the request that
builds the index is not the request that later reads it. So a user book lives in
the same Redis the playhead uses, behind a class with the same surface as
`hark.core.library.Library` -- `window`, `search`, `duration_hint`, `len` -- so
the tools in main.py never learn which kind of book they are holding.

The pipeline is deliberately resumable, one bounded slice of work per HTTP
request:

    transcribing -> indexing -> ready

Nothing here may block. A serverless function is killed at ten seconds, and
transcribing an audiobook takes minutes, so `advance()` does a little work,
writes down where it got to, and returns. The browser polls; each poll pushes
the job one step further. That also gives the page a real progress number
instead of a spinner that means nothing.
