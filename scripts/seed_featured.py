"""Transcribe and index the featured shelf, once, against a real store.

    python scripts/seed_featured.py                  # index anything missing
    python scripts/seed_featured.py --only walden    # just the ones that match
    python scripts/seed_featured.py --force          # rebuild them all
    python scripts/seed_featured.py --list           # show the shelf, seed nothing

These are the ready-made books every visitor sees. They are seeded from here
rather than through the API because the ids have to be fixed -- FEATURED_IDS in
hark/server/main.py names them -- and an endpoint that lets a caller choose its own
id is an endpoint that lets a caller overwrite someone else's book.

Each entry names an **archive.org identifier**, not a list of URLs. The file
list is fetched from archive.org's metadata API at run time and sorted, because
these books run to 117 files and a hand-typed list is 117 chances to put chapter
40 before chapter 4. Part order is the one mistake nothing downstream can
detect: get it wrong and every timestamp in the book is wrong, the index builds
cleanly, and the answers are confidently about the wrong passage.

Books are seeded shortest first, so the shelf is usable early and the longest
book is the only thing still running at the end.

Needs the production credentials in the environment:

    ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY,
    UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL, UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN

Without the Upstash pair the store falls back to process memory and this seeds
a dictionary that disappears when the script exits, so it refuses to run.
