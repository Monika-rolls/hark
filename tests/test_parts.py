"""Books made of many files.

A real audiobook is published one file per chapter, so a book is a list of
parts laid end to end on a single timeline. The arithmetic that shifts each
part's chunks onto that timeline is the part worth testing: get it wrong and a
question at 4:12:30 quietly returns the wrong chapter, which nothing else would
catch.
