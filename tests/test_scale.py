"""How large a book the retrieval layer can carry, and what it costs.

The size ceilings are settings now, and this deployment has them off, so
"how big can it get" stopped being rhetorical. These measure the layer that
would break first -- not AssemblyAI, which transcribed a 47-minute file in
about fifteen seconds, but the index that has to live in Redis and be read
back inside a function the platform kills at ten seconds.
